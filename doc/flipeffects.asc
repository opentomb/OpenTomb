Flipeffects

The Concept
^^^^^^^^^^^

As it was briefly mentioned <<trigaction-0x09-flipeffect,earlier>>, _flipeffect_ is a special pre-compiled routine which is called when some non-trivial event occurs. 

The concept of flipeffect is somewhat similar to _task_, i.e. when some flipeffect is engaged, it could be flagged by engine to call _every game frame_ (however, there are primarily one-shot flipeffects present). Such setup is needed for some complex flipeffect events, like flickering lights in TR1 Atlantis (see `FLICKER_FX` description), which stops automatically after some time. 

If flipeffect is flagged to execute every game frame, this flag can only be unset by own current flipeffect code (when its task is done -- for this purpose, special internal _flip timer_ is used to count how much time have passed since flipeffect activation) or replaced by any other flipeffect call (however, newly called flipeffect doesn't necessarily overwrite current flipeffect flag, so you can have one-shot flipeffect executed with another one queued for continuous execution). Ergo, _it's not possible to queue more than one _continuous_ flipeffect at a time, but it's possible to have one _one-shot_ and another _continuous_ flipeffect executed every game frame.

[NOTE]
====
Continuous flipeffects are mostly present in TR1 and TR2. In TR3, only two ``legacy'' continuous flipeffects remained, and in TR4 and TR5 there are no continuous flipeffects at all. However, there's still legacy code that checks if there's any continuous flipeffect queued.

Complete Flipeffect List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this chapter, we'll try to describe each flipeffect for every TR engine version. Given the fact that flipeffect listing changed from version to version, yet retaining common ones, the easiest way to lay them down is to create a table with flipeffect indexes corresponding to each game version.

There are some guidelines to flipeffect table:

* It's possible that same flipeffect goes under different names in different game versions. In this case, legacy flipeffect name will be preserved (for historical _[sic]_ reasons), and description will point to a flipeffect with more recent name. Legacy flipeffect names would be colored in [green]#green#.
* Flipeffect names are directly brought from native SDK or debug listings, where available (namely TR1, TR2, and TR4). When native names are wrong (which happens in TR4 and TR5 listings), new ones will be coined. New flipeffect names would be colored in [purple]#purple#.
* It's possible that legacy flipeffect code could migrate to later engine version without changes, but could be broken due to missing code in another part of engine or changes in internal structures. In this case, flipeffect name would be colored in [red]#red#.
* If there's an entry in engine's flipeffect list, but no actual code for it, it would be marked as (-).
* If actual flipeffect's purpose is unknown, it would be marked as (?).
* If flipeffect ought to be _continuous_, it will be marked in *bold*.

[NOTE]
====
As mentioned <<animcommand-structure,here>>, flipeffect could be called in two ways -- either by an entity via _AnimCommand_, or by _trigger action_. However, there are certain flipeffect which strictly require caller entity ID to work with (see effect descriptions for that). In such case, if flipeffect is called by trigger action, _resulting outcome is undefined_ in original engine. The most sane way to deal with this situation is to pass an ID of entity which activated given trigger.

On contrary, some flipeffects may require _certain trigger action_ and/or _certain trigger type_ to be called at the moment. In such case, if flipeffect is called via AnimCommand, _resulting outcome is undefined_ in original engine.

[NOTE]
====
In original engines, all flipeffects which name begins with `LARA_` prefix automatically take Lara character as an entity to work with. Also, most flipeffects with `_FX` postfix are simple sound effect events.
====

* `ROTATE_180` -- Rotates an entity 180 degrees around yaw axis _and also around pitch axis for underwater cases_. Mostly used in Lara roll animations. This flipeffect needs special approach if original animation frames are interpolated, because usually rotation is done on animation transition (e.g., frame 5 of Lara animation 48, which is second and final part of her roll movement). To prevent stray misaligned interpolated frames, this flipeffect must be performed only in the end of frame-to-frame interpolated sequence. 

* `TURN180` -- Same as `ROTATE_180`.

* `LARA_NORMAL` -- Resets certain internal Lara parameters to default ones, including movement modes, FOV and camera position.

* `FLOOR_SHAKE` -- If entity producing this effect is in less than 8 sector range, send _shake effect_ to camera. Shake effect is a variable which is inversely proportional to entity distance, and, when sent to camera, makes it shake with corresponding amplitude gradually fading out. If there are multiple FLOOR_SHAKE events constantly occuring nearby camera, _shake effect_ won't accumulate, but rather overwrite previous value.

* `DINO_STOMP` -- Same as `FLOOR_SHAKE`.

* `LARA_BUBBLES` -- When underwater, emit bubble sound (ID #37) and produce bubble particle for Lara. Position of bubble is linked to model's last mesh (which is headmesh in case of Lara). 

* `FINISH_LEVEL` -- Same effect as _TrigAction_ `0x07` -- immediately loads next level. For TR4, (which requires explicit level index to jump), current level index is increased and passed as level index to jump to.

* `FLIP_MAP` -- Equal to <<trigfunc_0x03,TrigAction `0x03`>>.

* `ACTIVATE_CAMERA` -- If there is a trigger type _Key_ (SubFunction `0x03`) being queued at the moment, and there are any _Camera_ TrigActions (`0x01`) present in `ActionList`, these TrigActions will be forced to activate at a given frame of _keyhole entity_ current animation, rather than at the ending frame of it. Works only for _keyhole entities_ which have complex activation animations, not single-frame ones. It can be used to change camera POV before keyhole animation is finished.

* `ACTIVATE_KEY` -- Same as above, but works for _Object_ TrigAction. That is, any entities to be activated from `ActionList` will be activated at a given frame of _keyhole entity_ current animation, rather than at the ending frame of it. Can be used to activate entities before actual keyhole animation is finished.

* `LARA_HANDSFREE` -- Functionally removes any weapon from Lara's hands. If called during holstering or unholstering operation, immediately aborts it. Note that holstering animation won't be automatically performed, and weapon model meshswaps won't be swapped back to normal hands.

* `DRAW_RIGHTGUN` -- Swaps given entity's mesh #10 index with same mesh's index from _PISTOLS_ANIM_ model (model ID #1 in all TR versions). Calling this effect again swaps mesh #10 back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes to create an illusion of Lara getting pistol in her right hand. 

* `DRAW_LEFTGUN` -- Swaps given entity's mesh #13 index with same mesh's index from _PISTOLS_ANIM_ model (model ID #1 in all TR versions). Calling this effect again swaps mesh #13 back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes to create an illusion of Lara getting pistol in her left hand.

* `SHOOT_RIGHTGUN` -- Activates given entity's muzzle flash effect and dynamic light near mesh #10. Muzzle flash position and orientation, as well as effect duration and intensity is hardcoded. Used primarily in cutscenes.

* `SHOOT_LEFTGUN` -- Activates given entity's muzzle flash effect and dynamic light near mesh #13. Muzzle flash position and orientation, as well as effect duration and intensity is hardcoded. Used primarily in cutscenes.

* `MESH_SWAP1` -- Swaps all given entity meshes with _MESH_SWAP1_ model meshes (model ID varies across TR versions). Each mesh is swapped only if source meshswap model mesh is not null, otherwise swap is ignored for a given mesh. Calling this flipeffect again swaps all meshes back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes.

* `MESH_SWAP2` -- Swaps all given entity meshes with _MESH_SWAP2_ model meshes (model ID varies across TR versions). Each mesh is swapped only if source meshswap model mesh is not null, otherwise swap is ignored for a given mesh. Calling this flipeffect again swaps all meshes back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes.

* `MESH_SWAP3` -- Swaps all given entity meshes with _MESH_SWAP3_ model meshes (model ID varies across TR versions). Each mesh is swapped only if source meshswap model mesh is not null, otherwise swap is ignored for a given mesh. Calling this flipeffect again swaps all meshes back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes.

* `CROWBAR` -- Swaps given entity's mesh #10 index with same mesh's index from _CROWBAR_ANIM_ model (either model ID #246 in TR4, or model ID #240 in TR5). Calling this flipeffect again swaps mesh #10 back to native. Used primarily in cutscenes to create an illusion of Lara getting crowbar in her hand.

* `POURSWAP_ON` -- Swaps given entity's mesh #10 index with same mesh's index from _LARA_WATER_MESH_ model (TR4, modei ID #25). Used in Lara's waterskin animations used in late TR4 levels with waterskin puzzle.

* `POURSWAP_OFF` -- Swaps given entity's mesh #10 back to native. Used in Lara's waterskin animations used in late TR4 levels with waterskin puzzle.

* `INV_ON` -- Hides given entity.

* `INV_OFF` -- Shows given entity, if it was hidden.

* `DYN_ON` -- Turns dynamic lights on for a given entity. Actual result is unclear.

* `DYN_OFF` -- Turns dynamic lights off for a given entity. Actual result is unclear.

* `RESET_HAIR` -- Presumably used to save Lara's ponytail from potential stuck during cutscenes by resetting all hair parameters to ``identity''.

* `SETFOG` -- When called by trigger action, changes global colour for volumetric fog effect. Takes `TriggerSetup` _Timer_ field as an index into hardcoded RGB table of colours (see  <<fog_bulb,this section>> for more info). If specified index is 100, engine temporarily turns off volumetric fog effect (possibly, this was used for debug purposes).

* `GHOSTTRAP` -- Kills all the living _WRAITH3_ entities (model ID #88 in TR4) this way: the wraith starts falling towards given entity. Reaching it or not, the wraith will die if it hits the floor of the room.

* `CLEARSCARABS` -- Removes all swarms of scarabs currently wandering in level.

* `KILLACTIVEBADDIES` -- Disable and remove all active NPCs from level.

* `KILLACTIVEBADDIES_2` -- Present only in TR5. It seems it's same as `KILLACTIVEBADDIES`, but some other processing is done.

* `RESET_NPC_BUFFER` -- No visible or significant effect on gameplay. If there are any NPCs in level, then this flipeffect will fill certain memory zone with zero bytes. This flipeffect seems like last-minute fix-up for some memory leak bug.

* `LARALOCATION` -- When activated, makes _Guide_ NPC (TR4, model ID #37) or _Von Croy_ NPC (TR4, model ID #39) to move to specific AI_FOLLOW object. Takes `TriggerSetup` _Timer_ field as an index to search for such OCB within AI objects array. When AI_FOLLOW AI object with same OCB index is found, NPC is then directed to this AI_FOLLOW object. This flipeffect also stores this index in additional global variable which is used to prevent NPC to get back to AI_FOLLOW objects with lower OCB indexes that were already passed -- for example, if NPC already passed AI_FOLLOW with OCB 2, he won't return to AI_FOLLOW with OCB 1, even if he hasn't been there before.

* `LARALOCATIONPAD` -- Same action as `LARALOCATION`, but with one difference - _Timer_ field is checked for certain values to engage either specific soundtrack and/or cinematic dialogue with _Von Croy_ NPC (for demonstration, look for Angkor Wat level walkthrough). This additional behaviour is hardcoded for TR4's first level index only.

* `ASSAULT_RESET` -- Resets assault course clock (for ex., when Lara stepped out of assault course).

* `ASSAULT_STOP` -- Stops assault course clock.

* `ASSAULT_START` -- Starts assault course clock.

* `ASSAULT_FINISHED` -- Finishes assault course clock and fixes the record. Depending on record time, plays either unbeat record (``I'm sure you can do better'', track ID #24 in TR2) soundtrack or best record (``Gosh, that was my best time yet'', track ID #22 in TR2, #95 in TR3) soundtrack. Record time is hardcoded to 100 seconds in TR2 and to 180 seconds in TR3. In TR3, flipeffect also checks if all targets in shooting range were hit by Lara, and if not, applies penalty of 10 seconds for each unhit target. Also, TR3 lacks ``unbeat record'' soundtrack.

* `ASSAULT_PENALTY_8` -- 8-second penalty for losing track on assault course.

* `ASSAULT_PENALTY_30` -- 30-second penalty for losing track on assault course.

* `RACETRACK_START` -- Prepare racetrack timer for counting lap time. _Only works when Lara is on a quadbike!_ As soon as quadbike leaves sector with this flipeffect, timer will start counting.

* `RACETRACK_RESET` -- Resets current lap time. _Only works when Lara is on a quadbike!_

* `RACETRACK_FINISHED` -- Finishes racetrack timer and fixes the record. _Only works when Lara is on a quadbike!_

* `GYM_HINT_1-19` -- Sequence of Lara's voice hints on how to complete gym training. Reason why these are activated via flipeffects rather than normal soundtrack is they must be engaged in predefined order, e.g. voice hint #8 can't play before #7 was played, and so on.

* `GYM_HINT_RESET` -- Resets gym training progress, so all voice hints will be played once again.

* `TUT_HINT_1-12` -- Sequence of Lara's voice hints on how to complete tutorial on Streets of Rome (TR5). Setup is similar to `GYM_HINT` flipeffects, but seems that there's no reset flipeffect to restart tutorial.

* `RAISINGBLOCK_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 117. Used in TR1, Palace Midas.

* `CHAINBLOCK_FX` -- Plays _global_ sounds with ID 173 and ID 33 with predefined interval. Used in TR1, Tomb of Tihocan.

* `EARTHQUAKE_FX` -- Shakes screen violently and plays sounds with ID 99 and 70 _globally_ with predefined intervals. Used in TR1, Palace Midas.

* `STAIRS2SLOPE_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 119 with predefined delay. Used in TR1, City of Khamoon.

* `SAND_FX` -- Plays _global_ sounds with ID 161, 118 and 155 with predefined intervals. Used in TR1, City of Khamoon.

* `POWERUP_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 155 for 1 second. Presumably used in TR1, one of the Atlantis levels, but never appears on map.

* `FLICKER_FX` -- Flips alternate rooms back and forth several times with predefined intervals, creating illusion of flickering light. Used in TR1, first room of Atlantis.

* `CHANDELIER_FX` --  Plays _global_ sound with ID 278 for 1 second. Used in TR2, Bartoli's Hideout.

* `BOILER_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 338. Used in TR2, Wreck of the Maria Doria.

* `PISTON_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 190. Used in TR2, Living Quarters.

* `CURTAIN_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 191. Used in TR2, Living Quarters.

* `SET_CHANGE_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 330. Used in TR2, Opera House and Temple of Xian.

* `STATUE_FX` -- Plays _global_ sound with ID 331. Used in TR2, Barkhang Monastery.

* `RUBBLE_FX` -- Plays _global_ rumble sound FX and holds camera shake effect for some time, then finishes it with ``shutting'' sound. {TR4}{TR5} If there are any _earthquake type_ objects in a level, engine engages same behaviour _locally_ for these objects.

* `TIMER_FIELD_FX` -- If this flipeffect is called by trigger action, play _global_ sound FX, taking `TriggerSetup` _Timer_ field as a sound ID.

* `EXPLOSION_FX` -- Plays _global_ explosion sound (ID #105) and produce full-screen flash graphical FX (TR3-5) or camera shake effect (TR1-2).

* `FLOOD_FX` -- Plays _global_ flooding sound (TR1 -- ID #81, TR2 -- ID #79, TR3 -- ID #163, TR4 -- ID #238). Implementation differs from version to version -- in TR1 and TR2 looped waterfall sound is used (which is then stopped by an engine after 1 second), while in TR3 and TR4 one-shot sound is engaged.
