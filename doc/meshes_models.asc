Meshes and Models
-----------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Nearly all of the non-geographic visual elements in TR (as well as a few parts of the landscape) consist of as meshes.  A 'mesh' is simply a list of vertices
and how they're arranged.  The mesh structure includes a list of vertices as relative coordinates (which allows meshes to easily be placed anywhere in the world
geometry), a list of normals (to indicate which side of each face is visible), and lists of Rectangles and Triangles, both textured and coloured.  The elements
of each <<tr_face4>> or <<tr_face3>> (or same version-specific) structure (Rectangles and Triangles) contain an offset into the `Vertices[]` array for the mesh.
Other arrays (`Moveables[]`, `StaticMeshes[]`) do not reference the array `Meshes[]` directly, but instead reference the array `MeshPointers[]`, which points to
locations inside of `Meshes[]`, inside of which the meshes are stored in packed fashion.

[TIP]
====
Pointer indexing system allows engine to share same mesh for numerous different models, and also easily implement a feature called 'meshswap' -- used when a
puzzle is inserted into a hole, when Lara draws pistols, and so on.

While it may be not obvious, but every time you see mesh look is changed, it means that 'meshswap' happened. There was never any other way to modify mesh looks
in classic TRs.

Meshes
~~~~~~

The sign of the number of normals specifies which sort of lighting to use. If the sign is positive, then external vertex lighting is used, with the lighting
calculated from the room's ambient and point-source lighting values. The latter appears to use a simple Lambert law for directionality: intensity is
proportional to latexmath:[$\max(\langle (\mathrm{normal direction}), (\mathrm{direction to source}) \rangle, 0)$]. If the sign is negative, then internal
vertex lighting is used, using the data included with the mesh.

CAUTION: This is not a ``real'' C/C++ structure, in that the arrays are sized by the `NumXXX` elements that precede them.

[source,cpp]
----
virtual struct tr_mesh
{
    tr_vertex Centre;
      int32_t CollRadius;

      int16_t NumVertices;           // Number of vertices in this mesh
    tr_vertex Vertices[NumVertices]; // List of vertices (relative coordinates)

      int16_t NumNormals;

  if(NumNormals > 0)
    tr_vertex Normals[NumNormals];
  else
      int16_t Lights[abs(NumNormals)];

     int16_t NumTexturedRectangles; // number of textured rectangles in this mesh
    tr_face4 TexturedRectangles[NumTexturedRectangles]; // list of textured rectangles

     int16_t NumTexturedTriangles;  // number of textured triangles in this mesh
    tr_face3 TexturedTriangles[NumTexturedTriangles]; // list of textured triangles

     int16_t NumColouredRectangles; // number of coloured rectangles in this mesh
    tr_face4 ColouredRectangles[NumColouredRectangles]; // list of coloured rectangles

     int16_t NumColouredTriangles; // number of coloured triangles in this mesh
    tr_face3 ColouredTriangles[NumColouredTriangles]; // list of coloured triangles
};
----

`Centre` is usually close to the mesh's centroid, and appears to be the center of a sphere used for certain kinds of collision testing.

`CollRadius` appears to be the radius of that aforementioned collisional sphere.

`NumNormals`: If positive, it is a number of normals in this mesh. If negative, it is a number of vertex lighting elements (`abs` value).

Depending on a value of `NumNormals`, next data block is interpreted either as `Normals[]` array (in `tr_vertex` format) or `Lights` array (just standard
`int16_t` values).

`NumTexturedTriangles` and `NumTexturedRectangles` are respectively the number of triangular and rectangular faces in this mesh. Corresponding
`TexturedTriangles` and `TexturedRectangles` array contain textured triangles and rectangles themselves.

`NumColoredTriangles` and `NumColoredRectangles` are respectively the number of triangular and rectangular faces in this mesh. Corresponding `ColoredTriangles`
and `ColoredRectangles` array contain colored triangles and rectangles themselves.

As coloured faces feature was removed since TR4, `tr_mesh` structure was changed, and contain no data for coloured faces anymore:

[source,cpp]
----
virtual struct tr4_mesh
{
    tr_vertex Centre;
      int32_t CollRadius;

      int16_t NumVertices;           // Number of vertices in this mesh
    tr_vertex Vertices[NumVertices]; // List of vertices (relative coordinates)

      int16_t NumNormals;

  if(NumNormals > 0)
    tr_vertex Normals[NumNormals];
  else
      int16_t Lights[abs(NumNormals)];

     int16_t NumTexturedRectangles; // number of textured rectangles in this mesh
    tr_face4 TexturedRectangles[NumTexturedRectangles]; // list of textured rectangles

     int16_t NumTexturedTriangles;  // number of textured triangles in this mesh
    tr_face3 TexturedTriangles[NumTexturedTriangles]; // list of textured triangles
};
----

Static Meshes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name tells, static meshes are meshes that don't move (e.g. skeletons lying on the floor, spiderwebs, trees, statues, etc.) Usually it implies that static
mesh is completely non-interactive, i.e. all it does is sitting there in place serving as an ornament.

NOTE: {TR4}{TR5} Since TR4, certain static meshes became 'destroyable' (either by shooting or exploding them), and even gained ability to activate 'heavy
triggers'. Such static meshes are called 'shatters'. Engine tells shatter statics from ordinary ones judging by their IDs, i.e. shatter static mesh must be in a
specific slot. This behaviour is hardcoded.

StaticMeshes have two 'bounding boxes'. First one serves as visibililty box, and other is the collisional box. The former is being used for visibility testing,
and the latter is used for collision testing.

[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_staticmesh   // 32 bytes
{
    uint32_t   ID;   // Object Identifier (matched in Items[])
    uint16_t   Mesh; // Mesh (offset into MeshPointers[])
    tr2_vertex VisibilityBox[2];
    tr2_vertex CollisionBox[2];
    uint16_t   Flags;
};
----

For `VisibilityBox` and `CollisionBox`, dimensions are specified using two vectors, first being the `bounding box minimum`, and second being the `bounding box
maximum`.

{TR1}{TR2} `Flags` value is usually 2, and is 3 for static meshes 'without collision', like plants and lying skeletons. Since TR3, value is ignored, and
no-collision mode is obtained using degenerate collision box (with all-zero or all-one coordinates).

Models
~~~~~~

This defines a list of contiguous meshes that comprise one object, which is called a 'model'. This structure also points to the hierarchy and offsets of the
meshes (`MeshTree`), and also to the animations used (`Animation`); these will be described in detail below. If the Animation index is -1, that means that there
are no predefined animations, and entity's movement is all generated by the engine; an example is Lara's ponytail or rolling balls from TR4 and TR5.

Some entities are really stationary, such as locks and the skybox, and some are not rendered at all, such as ``camera target'' points to aim the camera at,
flame emitters, AI objects and other service entities. Such invisible moveables are frequently called 'nullmeshes', because usually they have no valid mesh
index specified for them.

[[tr_model]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_model  // 18 bytes
{
    uint32_t ID;           // Model Identifier (matched in Items[])
    uint16_t NumMeshes;    // Number of meshes in this object
    uint16_t StartingMesh; // Stating mesh (offset into MeshPointers[])
    uint32_t MeshTree;     // Offset into MeshTree[]
    uint32_t FrameOffset;  // Byte offset into Frames[] (divide by 2 for Frames[i])
    uint16_t Animation;    // Offset into Animations[]
};
----

{TR5} There is an extra `uint16_t` at the end of `tr_moveable` structure, which is always `0xFFEF` and used for alignment. Consider it while parsing.

Entities
~~~~~~~~

Entities are the actual instances of either 'models' or 'sprites' (with the latter existing in TR1-2 only). For an entity to appear in a level, it must be
referenced in the `Items[]` array. Multiple instances of the same model are possible (e.g. two identical tigers in different rooms are represented using two
entries in `Items[]`, one for each). The object ID is used to locate the appropriate sprite sequence or model for the item.

[[tr_entity]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_entity
{
    int16_t EntityID; // Object Identifier (matched in Moveables[], or SpriteSequences[], as appropriate)
    int16_t Room;
    int32_t x;        // Item position in world coordinates
    int32_t y;
    int32_t z;
    int16_t Angle;
    int16_t Intensity1;
    int16_t Intensity2; // Like Intensity1, and almost always with the same value. [absent from TR1 data files]
    uint16_t Flags;
};
----

`Room` is a room ID to which this particular entity belongs to. If 'room' value was modified incorrectly, entity will glitch and, most likely, won't appear in
engine. That is, you can't change entity position without complementary edit or `Room` field.

`Angle` is an 'Euler Yaw angle' (i.e. ``horizontal'' rotation) stored in a special manner. To convert it to ordinary degrees, use this formula:

[width="100%",cols="^",frame="none",align="center"]
|====
|latexmath:[$\angle^\circle = (Angle \div 16384) \times -90$]
|====

{TR1} `Intensity2` field is missing in this game version, so the structure size is 2 bytes less.

`Intensity1`: If not -1, it is a value of constant lighting. -1 means ``use mesh lighting''.

`Flags` value contain packed list of several parameters:

* 'Bit 7' (`0x0080`) -- {TR1}{TR2}{TR3} 'Clear Body' flag. It is used together with 'Clear Bodies' trigger action to remove the body of dead enemy from the
  level to conserve resources.
* 'Bit 8' (`0x0100`) -- 'Invisible' flag. If entity has this flag set, it will be invisible on start-up. However, it only works for specific types of entities.
  It is primarily used with pick-ups or other entities which should appear at certain point only after activation, but are visible by default.
* 'Bits 9..13' (`0x3E00`) -- 'Activation Mask' for this entity. As you already learned in 'Trigger Actions' chapter, entity is only activated when 'activation
  mask is all set' (i.e. all 5 bits are set, and value is `0x1F`). However, activation mask doesn't strictly required to be set by trigger -- level editor
  allows to 'pre-define' activation mask, so entity will bear specific activation mask layout on level start-up.

If activation mask was pre-set to `0x1F` (all set), entity will activate 'immediately after level loading', and engine will also 'reset activation mask to zero'
and 'mark entity as inactive', effectively swapping ``inactive'' state with ``active''. That is, when player will activate such pre-activated entity with a
trigger, it will actually ``deactivate'', et cetera. Most prominent example of this behaviour is pre-opened grated door in Tomb of Qualopec.

Sprites
~~~~~~~

These are ``billboard'' objects that are always rendered perpendicular to the view direction. These are used for text and explosion effects and similar things;
they are also used for some scenery objects and pickup items, though this use gets less as one goes from TR1 to TR3. The various ``Sides'' below are the
positions of the sprite sides relative to the sprite's overall position, measured in TR's world-coordinate units.

[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_sprite_texture   // 16 bytes
{
    uint16_t Tile;
     uint8_t x;
     uint8_t y;
    uint16_t Width;        // actually (Width * 256) + 255
    uint16_t Height;       // actually (Height * 256) + 255
     int16_t LeftSide;
     int16_t TopSide;
     int16_t RightSide;
     int16_t BottomSide;
};
----


Sprite Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are collections of sprites that are referred to as a group. The members of this group can be cycled through (animated sprites such as flames) or selected
in other ways (text). Some sequences have only one member; this is done so as to access all the sprites in the same way.

[source,cpp]
----
struct tr2_sprite_sequence  // 8 bytes
{
    int32_t EntityID; // Item identifier (matched in Items[])
    int16_t NegativeLength; // negative of ``how many sprites are in this sequence''
    int16_t Offset; // where (in sprite texture list) this sequence starts
};
