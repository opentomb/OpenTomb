Miscellany
----------

These are various odds and ends that do not fit into the earlier categories.

Version
~~~~~~~

Every level file begins with a `uint32_t` version number.  This seems to be used by the engine to guarantee compatibility between various level editor versions
and the game engine version.  More generally, it can be used to determine what sort of level is being read.

Here are the known (observed) values for the version header:

* `0x00000020` -- Tomb Raider 1, Gold, Unfinished Business
* `0x0000002D` -- Tomb Raider 2
* `0xFF080038` -- Tomb Raider 3
* `0xFF180038` -- Tomb Raider 3
* `0x00345254` -- Tomb Raider 4 and Tomb Raider 5
* `0x63345254` -- Tomb Raider 4 (demo versions)

[NOTE]
Early TR4 demos (e.g. _September 15 demo_) have whole level file packed into a single zlib chunk. Therefore, there is no header.

[NOTE]
TR5 version header is equal to TR4 version header.  So there is no way to tell TR4 level from TR5 level judging only by this header -- you need to check
filename extension as well.

[NOTE]
As it was noted, _retail_ version of TR4 expects to load sound samples compressed in MS-ADPCM format, while _TRLE_ version of TR4 loads uncompressed
samples only. There is no way to tell _retail_ version from _TRLE_ version, as their version numbers are equal.

Palette
~~~~~~~

This consists of 256 <<tr_colour>> structs, one for each palette entry. However, the individual colour values range from 0 to 63; they must be multiplied by 4
to get the correct values.

This used for all 8-bit colour, such as 8-bit textures.

Object Textures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Object texture (or _texture details_ in TRLE terms) keeps detailed information about each texture independently used in game. While it's not texture image
itself (these are kept inside _texture tiles_), it's rather a reference to particular texture tile zone kept with all other necessary information to display
this texture.

Object Texture Vertex Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sub-structure used by object textures specifies a vertex location in textile coordinates. The Xpixel and Ypixel are the actual coordinates of the vertex's pixel.
The Xcoordinate and Ycoordinate values depend on where the other vertices are in the object texture. And if the object texture is used to specify a triangle,
then the fourth vertex's values will all be zero.

[[tr_object_texture_vert]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_object_texture_vert	// 4 bytes
{
    uint8_t Xcoordinate; // 1 if Xpixel is the low value, 255 if Xpixel is the high value in the object texture
    uint8_t Xpixel;
    uint8_t Ycoordinate; // 1 if Ypixel is the low value, 255 if Ypixel is the high value in the object texture
    uint8_t Ypixel;
};
----

Object Texture Structure (TR1-3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's object texture structure itself. These, thee contents of `ObjectTextures[]`, are used for specifying texture mapping for the world geometry and for mesh objects.

[[tr_object_texture]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_object_texture	// 20 bytes
{
    uint16_t Attribute;
    uint16_t TileAndFlag;
    tr_object_texture_vert Vertices[4]; // The four corners of the texture
};
----

`TileAndFlag` is a combined field:

* _Bits 0..14_ specify _texture tile_ to use.
* _Bit 15_: if set, it indicates that texture is used on a triangle face.

`Attribute` specifies transparency mode (i.e. _blending mode_) used for face with this texture applied. There are several ones available:

* *0* -- Texture is _all-opaque_, and that transparency information is ignored.
* *1* -- Texture uses _alpha testing_, i.e. it may contain opaque and completely transparent regions. In 8-bit colour, index 0 is the transparent colour, while
  in 16-bit colour, the top bit (0x8000) is the alpha channel (1 = opaque, 0 = transparent). In 32-bit textures, transparency is specified by _full magenta
  colour value_ (RGB = 255,0,255) -- i.e. pixel has to be magenta to be transparent.
* *2* -- {TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Texture uses _alpha blending_ with _additive operation_. No depth sorting is done on alpha-blended textures.

[NOTE]
====
While blending modes 0, 1 and 2 were the only ones directly available for implementation in original level and animation editors, and therefore, only ones which
can be encountered in object textures, there are actually several _internal blending modes_, which were primarily used for different sprite and particle types.
These will be listed below:
====

* *3* -- Not implemented properly in PC version, but on PlayStation this type produces alpha blending with _inversion operation_, thus converting all the bright
  zones to dark, and dark zones to bright. This blending mode was used for smooth textured shadows, footprints and black smoke sprites. There is a remnant of
  this blending mode in the form of entity type named _smoke emitter black_.
* *4* -- Alpha-tested face _without Z testing_, i.e. depth information is ignored. Used for GUI elements (such as fonts) and skyboxes.
* *5* -- Unused. Possibly was used in PlayStation versions.
* *6* -- Wireframe mode. Used for ``line particles'', such as gun sparks, water drops and laser beams. Possibly was also used for debug purposes.
* *7* -- {TR4}{TR5} Forced alpha value. It's ordinary alpha-tested face, but alpha value for this face is overridden with global variable. Used to ``fade out''
  specific meshes, like vanishing enemy bodies or Semerkhet ghost in ``Tomb of Semerkhet'' level.


Object Texture Structure (TR4-5)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure introduced many new fields in TR4, partly related to new _bump mapping feature_.

For _bump mapping_, TR4 used fairly simple approach, which was actually not a true bump mapping, but multitexturing with additive operation. Therefore, bump
maps were not _normal maps_ mainly used for bump-mapping nowadays, but simple monochrome _heightmaps_ automatically generated by level editor. This is a test
screenshot comparison demonstrating same scene with and without bump mapping:

[width="70%",cols="^,^",frame="none",align="center"]
|====
| image:illustrations/bump-no.jpg[title="Without bump mapping"] | image:illustrations/bump-yes.jpg[title="With bump mapping"]
| _Bump mapping turned off_ | _Bump mapping turned on_
|====

Assignation of bump maps happened inside level editor, where each texture piece could be marked as either _level 1_ or _level 2_ degree of bump map effect. When
level was converted, all texture pieces with bumpmaps were placed into separate texture tiles after all other texture tiles, following by the same amount of
texture tiles with auto-generated bump maps arranged in the same manner as original texture tiles. Number of bumped texture tiles was kept in separate variable
as well (see <<level_format_tr4,TR4 Level Format>> section).

So, when engine rendered a face with texture marked as _bumped_, it rendered original texture at first, then it jumped to the texture tile _plus number of
bumped texture tiles_, and rendered one more texture pass on this face using texture from resulting texture tile and the same UV coordinates.

[[tr4_object_texture]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr4_object_texture	// 38 bytes
{
    uint16_t Attribute;
    uint16_t TileAndFlag;
    uint16_t NewFlags;

    tr_object_texture_vert Vertices[4]; // The four corners of the texture

    uint32_t OriginalU;
    uint32_t OriginalV;
    uint32_t Width;     // Actually width-1
    uint32_t Height;    // Actually height-1
};
----

`NewFlags` is a bit field with flags:

* *Bits 0..2* -- Mapping correction. It seems that these bits change the way the texture is applied.
* *Bits 11..12* -- Specifies bump mapping level (see above), so can be either `00 = 0` (no bump mapping), `01 = 1` (level 1) or `10 = 2` (level 2).
* *Bit 15* -- If set, the texture is for a triangle/quad from a room geometry. If not set, the texture is for a static mesh or model.

`Width` and `Height` are helper values which specify width and height for a given object texture.

`OriginalU` and `OriginalV` are unused values, which seem to identify _original UV coordinates_ of object texture in TRLE texture page listings. These
coordinates are getting messed up when level is compiled, so one shouldn't bother about parsing them correctly.

{TR5} There is also null `uint16_t` filler in the end of each <<tr4_object_texture>>.

Animated Textures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Animated textures describe sets of object textures that are cycled through to produce texture animations; they are a set of int16_t's with the following format
(not a ``real'' C/C++ structure):

[[animated_textures]]
[source,cpp]
----
int16_t NumAnimatedTextures

virtual struct
{
    int16_t NumTextureIDs; // Actually, this is the number of texture ID's - 1.
    int16_t TextureIDs[NumTextureIDs + 1]; // offsets into ObjectTextures[], in animation order.
} AnimatedTextures[NumAnimatedTextures];
----

If a texture belongs to an animated-texture group, it will automatically be animated by the engine.

There are two types of animated textures -- _classic frames_ and _UVRotate_:

* *Classic frames:* These are ordinary animated textures, and the only type displayed prior to TR4. It is simply a list of textures that are cycled through in
  an endless loop; they are normally used as geographic elements of the levels (e.g. water surface, bubbling lava, Atlantean flesh walls), but practically, Tomb
  Raider engines are capable of applying animated textures to mesh geometry (this feature is primarily used in custom levels). The speed (interval) of animation
  is hardcoded, and varies from version to version. While in TR1-2 textures were animated relatively slowly, in TR3 onwards they were sped up.
* *UV Rotate:* Beginning from TR4, there is a new scheme for animated textures, called _UVRotate_. According to its name, it continuously shifts vertical
  texture coordinate while preserving texture size, which creates an effect of moving texture. For example, you can see it in action in TR4's `angkor1.tr4`,
  room #76:

[width="70%",cols="^",frame="none",align="center"]
|====
| image:illustrations/uvrotate.jpg[title="UVRotate texture animation in action"]
| In foreground, you can see alpha-blended waterfall object animated with UVRotate.
  In background, UVRotate animation is also applied to room mesh.
|====

UVRotate mode is engaged by specifying `UVRotate` command in level script entry, which takes rotation speed as an argument, where speed is amount of pixel shift per each frame, considering fixed 30 FPS framerate (speed value may be negative, and in such cases pixel shift occurs in reverse direction). If such command is found (and
argument is not zero -- for example, `UVRotate = 4`), engine uses special variable value kept in level file, `NumUVRotates`, to determine if
animation range belongs to UVRotate mode or classic frames mode. Then, if it belongs to UVRotate mode, each frame of this range is treated as individual
rotating texture.

[NOTE]
====
There is also special case when UVRotate texture mode is engaged. When a texture is applied to a model with specific ID (so-called _waterfall objects_), then it
is also considered UVRotate animated texture, even if it doesn't belong to animated texture range, _but only if it is a texture applied to a first face in the
first mesh of the model_. If there are other textures applied to other faces of a waterfall object, they won't be considered as UVRotate.

The speed of animation for waterfall objects is not affected by `UVRotate` script command. Instead, it is hardcoded value of 7.
====

Cameras and Sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This data block serves for two different purposes, albeit keeping the same structure for both. First purpose is to provide positions to switch the camera to
using _Camera_ trigger action, and the second purpose is to _move Lara to specified position_ when she is underwater, and _Underwater Current_ trigger action
was used.

[[tr_camera]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_camera // 16 bytes
{
    int32_t x;
    int32_t y;
    int32_t z;
    int16_t Room;
   uint16_t Flag;
};
----

`X`, `Y` and `Z` values are coordinates of a given camera or sink. When used with camera, it is an origin point of a camera. When used with sink, it is a point, towards which Lara is pushed.

`Room` value specifies the room where camera is placed. For _sink_ cases, this value is used to define _strength of the current_ which moves Lara underwater.

`Flag` value _for cameras_ specifies whether it's possible to breakout from fixed camera angle. If first bit of this field is set, camera becomes persistent, and it's not possible to bypass it with look or draw weapon buttons. For _sinks_, there is some info that `Flag` is used as a `Zone[]` reference.

Flyby Cameras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{TR4}{TR5} Flyby cameras are cinematic interludes, in which camera flies from one point to another using spline trajectory. Each point in such sequence is a
_single flyby camera_, and current camera properties (position, direction, roll, FOV, speed, and some more) are calculated by interpolating corresponding values
from such flyby camera points -- for example, if _camera 0_ has speed value of 10, and _camera 1_ has speed value of 5, then speed will gradually change from 10
to 5 when moving from one to another.

[[tr4_flyby_camera]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr4_flyby_camera  // 40 bytes
{
    int32_t x;		// Camera position
    int32_t y;
    int32_t z;
    int32_t dx;		// Camera angles (so called "look at" vector)
    int32_t dy;
    int32_t dz;

    uint8_t Sequence;
    uint8_t Index;

   uint16_t FOV;
    int16_t Roll;
   uint16_t Timer;
   uint16_t Speed;
   uint16_t Flags;

   uint32_t Room_ID;
};
----

`Sequence` is a number of flyby camera ``chain'' this particular camera belongs to. Maximum amount of flyby sequences in single level is 8 (however, this limit
was raised to 64 in _TREP_).

`Index` specifies order of the cameras in this particular sequence. Camera with `index` 0 will be first one in sequence, `index` 1 means camera will be second
in sequence, and so on.

`Room_ID` should be valid for a given flyby camera, so it will display properly, as well as have the ability to activate _heavy triggers_.

`FOV` changes this particular camera's field of view. The value is 182 times higher than the value entered in the TRLE.

`Roll` changes roll factor of a particular camera. When this parameter is not zero, camera will rotate either left or right along roll axis, creating so-called
``dutch angle''. The value is 182 times higher than the value entered in the TRLE.

`Timer` field mainly used to stop camera movement for a given time (in game frames). As this parameter is temporal, it won't be interpolated between two cameras.

`Speed` specifies movement speed for this particular camera. The value is 655 times higher than the value entered in the TRLE.

`Flags` is an array of bit flags specifying different camera options:

* *Bit 0* -- Make a cut to flyby from Lara camera position. Without it, it'll pan smoothly.
* *Bit 1* -- {TR4} Tracks specified entity position (from ++Entities[]++ array). {TR5} Creates a vignette around the picture, giving impression of "subjective" camera.
* *Bit 2* -- Infinitely loop sequence.
* *Bit 3* -- _Used only with first camera in a sequence:_ whole sequence is treated merely as a camera ``rails'', and camera itself focuses on Lara, thus
  creating ``tracking'' camera. Best example is ``tracking'' view in `ALEXHUB2.TR4`, rooms #23 and #31.
* *Bit 4* -- {TR4} Camera focuses on Lara's last head position. {TR5} For TR5, this flag is now used to hide Lara for this camera.
* *Bit 5* -- Camera continuously focuses on Lara's head, overriding own angle.
* *Bit 6* -- _Used only with last camera in a sequence:_ camera smoothly pans back to Lara camera position.
* *Bit 7* -- When flyby arrives to this position, cuts to specific camera in same sequence. Next camera number is specified in _Timer_ field of this camera.
* *Bit 8* -- Stops camera movement for a given time (see _Timer_ field).
* *Bit 9* -- Disables look keypress breakout.
* *Bit 10* -- Disables all Lara controls _for all next camera points_. Also engages _widescreen bars_ to create cinematic feel.
* *Bit 11* -- Overrides _Bit 10_ controls lock, enabling them back. Widescreen bars remain unaffected.
* *Bit 12* -- {TR5} Make screen fade-in.
* *Bit 13* -- {TR5} Make screen fade-out.
* *Bit 14* -- Camera can activate _heavy triggers_, just like particular kinds of entities (boulders, pushables, etc.). When camera is moving right above heavy trigger sector, it will be activated.
* *Bit 15* -- {TR5} TRLE for TR5 says this flag is used to make camera one-shot, but it's not true. Actual one-shot flag is placed in extra ++uint16_t++ field at `0x0100` for flyby camera _TrigAction_.


Cinematic Frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are camera positionings for cutscenes. All the entity animations are specified separately, and they are not synced with actual camera positions.

[[tr_cinematic_frame]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_cinematic_frame // 16 bytes
{
    int16_t rotY;    // rotation about Y axis, +/- 32767 == +/- 180 degrees
    int16_t rotZ;    // rotation about Z axis, +/- 32767 == +/- 180 degrees
    int16_t rotZ2;   // seems to work a lot like rotZ;  I haven't yet been able to
                     // differentiate them
    int16_t posZ;    // camera position relative to something (target? Lara? room
                     // origin?).  pos* are _not_ in world coordinates.
    int16_t posY;    // camera position relative to something (see posZ)
    int16_t posX;    // camera position relative to something (see posZ)
    int16_t unknown; // changing this can cause a runtime error
    int16_t rotX;    // rotation about X axis, +/- 32767 == +/- 180 degrees
};
----


LightMap
~~~~~~~~

A 32*256 array of `uint8_t` which is apparently for applying light to 8-bit colour, in some documentation called `ColourMap`. The current palette index and
lighting value are used to calcuate an index to this table, which is a table of palette indices.

The Tomb Raider series' software rendering, like that of most real-time-3D games, uses 8-bit colour for speed and low bulk; however, there is the serious
problem of how to do lighting with 8-bit colour, because doing it directly is computationally expensive. The usual solution is to arrange the palettes' colours
in ramps, which the engine then follows in the appropriate directions. However, the TR series' palettes generally lack such neat ramps.

But the TR series has a more general solution, one that does not require palettes to have colour ramps. It uses precalculated lighting tables, the `ColourMap`
objects. These contain translations of a colour value and a lighting value, listed by palette index. The translation goes as follows:

`n = ColourMap[256 * k + i];`

where `i` is the original palette index, `k` is determined from the lighting value, and `n` is the new palette index. The lighting index `k` varies from 0 to
31, and the corresponding lighting value is, [red]#for TR1#,

`2 - k / 16`

and for TR2 and TR3,

`2 - (k + 1) / 16`

This may be associated with the curious fact of the lighting values in the data files increasing in the ``wrong'' direction in TR1 and TR2, with 0 being full
brightness and greater values being darker.
