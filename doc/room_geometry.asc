Room Geometry
-------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A _room_ in TR2 is simply a rectangular three-dimensional area. A room may be ``indoors'' or ``outdoors,'' may or may not be enclosed, may be
accessible or inaccessible to Lara, may or may not contain doors or objects.

All rooms have ``portals,'' called ``doors'' in some documentation, which are pathways to adjacent rooms. There are two kinds of portals -- visibility portals
and collisional portals. Visibility portals are for determining how much of a room (if any) is visible from another room, while collisional portals are for
enabling an object to travel from one room to another.

The visibility portals are most likely for doing ``portal rendering'', which is a visibility-calculation scheme that goes as follows: the viewpoint is a member
of some room, which is then listed as visible from it. This room's portals are checked for visibility from that viewpoint, and visible portals have their
opposite-side rooms marked as visible. These rooms are then checked for portals that are visible from the viewpoint through the viewpoint's room's portals, and
visible ones have their opposite-side rooms marked as visible. This operation is repeated, with viewing through intermediate portals, until all visible portals
have been found. The result is a tree of rooms, starting from the viewpoint's room; only those rooms and their contents need to be rendered.

It is clear that both visibility and collision calculations require that objects have room memberships given for them, and indeed we shall find that most map
objects have room memberships.

Rooms may overlap; as we shall see, this is involved in how horizontal collisional portals are implemented. However, different rooms may overlap without either
being directly accessible from the other; there are several inadvertent examples of such ``5D space'' in the Tomb Raider series. The only possibly deliberate
example I know of is the flying saucer in ``Area 51'' in TR3, whose interior is bigger than its exterior.

A room can have an ``alternate room'' specified for it; that means that that room can be replaced by that alternate as the game is running. This trick is used
to produce such tricks as empty rooms vs. rooms full of water, scenery rearrangements (for example, the dynamited house in ``Bartoli's Hideout'' in TR2), and so
forth. An empty room is first created, and then a full room is created at its location from a copy of it. The empty room then has that full room set as its
alternate, and when that room is made to alternate, one sees a full room rather than an empty one.

The rooms are stored sequentially in an array, and ``Room Numbers'' are simply indices into this array (e.g. ``Room Number 5'' is simply `Rooms[5]`; the first
room is `Rooms[0]`).

Rooms are divided into _sectors_ (or _squares_), which are 1024x1024 unit squares that form a grid on the latexmath:[$X-Z$] plane. Sectors are the defining area
for floor/ceiling heights and triggers (e.g. a tiger appears and attacks when Lara steps on a given square); the various attributes of each sector are stored in
the Sector Data (described in this section) and the <<FloorData>>.  As an aside, Sectors correspond to the ``squares,'' easily visible in all of the Tomb Raider
games, that experienced players count when gauging jumps;  they also account for some of the game's less-appealing graphic artifacts. Careful tiling and texture
construction can make these ``squares'' almost invisible.

[NOTE]
====
Each room has two types of surface geometry -- _rendered_ and _collisional_. The former are what is _seen_, while the latter control how objects _collide_ and
'interact' with the world. Furthermore, these two types are specified separately in the room data -- each type is _completely independent of other_, i. e.
collisional geometry shouldn't exactly match visible room geometry.

While this distinctive feature was never used in originals (collisional room ``meshes'' fully resembled visible room ``meshes''), it is now extensively used by
level editing community with the help of a program called _meta2tr_. This utility allows level builder to replace visible geometry generated by _TRLE_ with any
custom geometry, usually modelled in _Metasequoia_ 3D editor (hence the name of _meta2tr_ utility).
====

Rooms are defined with a complex structure, which is described below ``inside-out,'' meaning that the smaller component structures are described first, followed
by the larger structures that are built using the smaller structures.

Room Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Room header
^^^^^^^^^^^

latexmath:[$X / Z$] indicate the base position of the room mesh in world coordinates (latexmath:[$Y$] is always zero-relative)

[[tr_room_info]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_info    // 16 bytes
{
    int32_t x;             // X-offset of room (world coordinates)
    int32_t z;             // Z-offset of room (world coordinates)
    int32_t yBottom;
    int32_t yTop;
};
----

`yBottom` is actually largest value, but indicates _lowest_ point in the room.
`yTop` is actually smallest value, but indicates _highest_ point in the room.

TR5 uses an extended version of this structure:

[[tr5_room_info]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr5_room_info    // 20 bytes
{
    int32_t x;             // X-offset of room (world coordinates)
    int32_t y;             // Y-offset of room (world coordinates) - only in TR5
    int32_t z;             // Z-offset of room (world coordinates)
    int32_t yBottom;
    int32_t yTop;
};
----

The additional `y` value is usually 0.

Portal Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These portals, sometimes called ``doors'', define the view from a room into another room. This can be through a ``real'' door, a window, or even some open area
that makes the rooms look like one big room. Note that ``rooms'' here are really just areas; they aren't necessarily enclosed.  The portal structure below
defines _only visibility portals_, not an actual door model, texture, or action (if any).  And if the portal is not properly oriented, the camera cannot
``see'' through it.

[[tr_room_portal]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_portal  // 32 bytes
{
    uint16_t  AdjoiningRoom; // Which room this portal leads to
    tr_vertex Normal;
    tr_vertex Vertices[4];
};
----

`Normal` field tells which way the portal faces (the normal points _away_ from the adjacent room; to be seen through, it must point _toward_ the viewpoint).

`Vertices` are the corners of this portal (the right-hand rule applies with respect to the normal). If the right-hand-rule is not followed, the portal will
contain visual artifacts instead of a viewport to `AdjoiningRoom`.

Room Sector Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the geometry specified here is _collisional geometry_.

[[tr_room_sector]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_sector // 8 bytes
{
    uint16_t FDindex;    // Index into FloorData[]
    uint16_t BoxIndex;   // Index into Boxes[] (-1 if none)
    uint8_t  RoomBelow;  // 255 is none
    int8_t   Floor;      // Absolute height of floor
    uint8_t  RoomAbove;  // 255 if none
    int8_t   Ceiling;    // Absolute height of ceiling
};
----

`Floor` and `Ceiling` are signed numbers of 256 units of height (relative to 0) -- e.g. Floor `0x04` corresponds to latexmath:[$Y = 1024$] in world coordinates.
Therefore, 256 units is a _minimum vertical stride of collisional geometry_. However, this rule could be broken by specific entities, which Lara can stand on.
But _horizontal_ sector dimensions, which, as mentioned earlier, are 1024 x 1024 (in world coordinates), could not. Therefore, minimal horizontal platform
dimensions, on which Lara can stand and grab, are 1024 x 1024 as well.

NOTE: This implies that, while latexmath:[$X$] and latexmath:[$Z$] can be quite large, latexmath:[$Y$] is constrained to -32768..32512.

`Floor` and `Ceiling` value of `0x81` is a magic number used to indicate impenetrable walls around the sector. `Floor` values are used by the game engine to
determine what objects Lara can traverse and how. Relative steps of 1 (-256) can be walked up; steps of 2..7 (-512..-1792) can/must be jumped up; steps larger
than 7 (-2048..-32768) cannot be jumped up (too tall).

`RoomAbove` and `RoomBelow` values indicate what neighboring rooms are in these directions -- the number of the room below this one and the number of the room
above this one. If `RoomAbove` is not _none_, then the ceiling is a _collisional portal_ to that room, while if `RoomBelow` is not _none_, then the floor is a
'collisional portal' to that room.

Also, `RoomBelow` value is extensively used by engine to determine actual sector data and triggers in so-called _stacked room setups_, when one room is placed
above another through collisional portal. The thing is, engine uses sector data and triggers _only for the lowest sector_ of the stacked room setup, so it
recursively scans for a lowest room to determine which sector to use.

`FDindex` is a pointer to specific entry in <<FloorData>> array, which keeps all the information about sector flags, triggers and other parameters. While it is
implied that one `FDindex` entry may be shared between several sectors, it is usually not the case with original Tomb Raider levels built with _TRLE_. However,
'Dxtre3d' takes advantage of this feature and may optimize similar sectors to share same FDindex pointer.

`BoxIndex` is a pointer to special <<Boxes>> array entry, which is basically a subset of sectors with same height configuration. It is primarily used for AI
pathfinding (see the <<non-player-character-behaviour,Non-player character behaviour>> chapter for more details).

{TR3}{TR4}{TR5} In these games, `BoxIndex` field is more complicated, and actually contains _two packed values_. Bits 4..14 contain the _actual box index_, and
bits 0..3 contain _material index_, which is used to produce specific footstep sound, when Lara is walking or running in this sector. On PlayStation game
versions, this index was also used to determine if footprint textures should be applied to this particular place.

Majority of _material index_ values are the same across game versions, but some of them exist only in particular game. Here is the description:

* *0* -- Mud
* *1* -- Snow (TR3 and TR5 only)
* *2* -- Sand
* *3* -- Gravel
* *4* -- Ice (TR3 and TR5 only)
* *5* -- Water _(unused, as water footstep is only activated in water rooms)_
* *6* -- Stone _(unused, as it is default footstep sound)_
* *7* -- Wood
* *8* -- Metal
* *9* -- Marble (TR4 only)
* *10* -- Grass _(same sound effect as sand)_
* *11* -- Concrete _(same sound effect as stone, hence unused)_
* *12* -- Old wood _(same sound effect as wood)_
* *13* -- Old metal _(same sound effect as metal)_

Mud, snow, sand, grass and maybe some other materials produce footprints in PlayStation version.

Furthermore, in TR3-5, _actual box index_ may contain special value 2047, which is most likely indicates that this sector is a slope on which Lara can slide
(and, therefore, possibly impassable by most NPCs).

Room Light Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: TR engines always used static room lights only for processing lighting on entities (such as Lara, enemies, doors, and others). This is called _external
lighting_. For room meshes, they used so-called internal, or _pre-baked_ lighting, which is done on level building stage: lights are calculated and applied to
room faces via vertex colours. There is no way to change room lighting when the level is compiled -- meaning, any changes in light positions, intensities and
colour won't affect room faces.

There are four different types of room light structures. First one is used in TR1-2, second is used in TR3, third is used in TR4, and fourth is used in TR5.
Here is the description of each:

TR1 Room Lighting
+++++++++++++++++

[[tr_room_light]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_light   // 18 bytes
{
     int32_t x, y, z;       // Position of light, in world coordinates
    uint16_t Intensity1;    // Light intensity
    uint32_t Fade1;         // Falloff value
};
----

`X/Y/Z` are in world coordinates. `Intensity1/Intensity2` are almost always equal. This lighting only affects _externally-lit_ objects. Tomb Raider 1 has only
the first of the paired `Intensity` and `Fade` values.

`Intensity1` ranges from 0 (dark) to 0x1FFF (bright). However, some rooms occasionally have some lights with intensity greater than 0x1FFF (for example, look at
room #9, 2nd light in `level1.phd`). `Fade1` is the maximum distance the light shines on, and ranges from 0 to 0x7FFF.

TR2 Room Lighting
+++++++++++++++++

TR2 uses an extended version of TR1 light structure:

[[tr2_room_light]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr2_room_light   // 24 bytes
{
     int32_t x, y, z;       // Position of light, in world coordinates
    uint16_t Intensity1;    // Light intensity
    uint16_t Intensity2;    // Only in TR2
    uint32_t Fade1;         // Falloff value
    uint32_t Fade2;         // Only in TR2
};
----

`Intensity2` and `Fade2` values are seemingly not used. `Intensity1` can go very well beyond 0x1FFF, right to 0x7FFF (ultra bright light). Above 0x7FFF, it is
always black, so the number is pseudo-signed (negative values are always treated as zero).

TR3 Room Lighting
+++++++++++++++++

[[tr3_room_light]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr3_room_light   // 24 bytes
{
        int32_t x, y, z;       // Position of light, in world coordinates
     tr_colour4 Colour;        // Colour of the light
       uint32_t Intensity;
       uint32_t Fade;          // Falloff value
};
----

`Intensity` is the power of the light and ranges mainly from 0 (low power) to 0x1FFF (high power). Though, values greater than 0x1FFF do exist and their
meanings are unknown. `Fade` is the distance max the light can shine on. Range is mainly from 0 to 0x7FFF, but negative values do exist and their meanings are
unknown.

TR4 Room Lighting
+++++++++++++++++

[[tr4_room_light]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr4_room_light   // 46 bytes
{
        int32_t x, y, z;       // Position of light, in world coordinates
      tr_colour Colour;        // Colour of the light

        uint8_t LightType;
        uint8_t Unknown;       // Always 0xFF?
        uint8_t Intensity;

          float In;            // Also called hotspot in TRLE manual
          float Out;           // Also called falloff in TRLE manual
          float Length;
          float CutOff;

          float dx, dy, dz;    // Direction - used only by sun and spot lights
};
----

`LightType` is somewhat similar to D3D light type, but there are some differences.

* *0* -- Sun
* *1* -- Light
* *2* -- Spot
* *3* -- Shadow
* *4* -- Fog bulb

[NOTE]
====
_Fog bulb_ is a special case of room light, which actually don't work as usual light. It serves as a point in space, where a kind of _volumetric fog_ effect is
generated. It works only if user has enabled corresponding option in game setup.

Fog bulbs don't use `Colour` field to define its colour. However, `Red` field of a `Colour` structure is used to define fog density. Colour itself can be only
changed with special _flipeffect #28_ trigger function, which takes a value from the _timer field_ of the trigger to index into hardcoded RGB table of
pre-defined colours. The table consists of 28 RGB values:

TR5 Room Lighting
+++++++++++++++++

[[tr5_room_light]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr5_room_light   // 88 bytes
{
        float x, y, z;       // Position of light, in world coordinates
        float r, g, b;       // Colour of the light

       uint32_t Separator    // Dummy value = 0xCDCDCDCD

        float In;            // Cosine of the IN value for light / size of IN value
        float Out;           // Cosine of the OUT value for light / size of OUT value
        float RadIn;         // (IN radians) * 2
        float RadOut;        // (OUT radians) * 2
        float Range;         // Range of light

        float dx, dy, dz;    // Direction - used only by sun and spot lights
      int32_t x2, y2, z2;    // Same as position, only in integer.
      int32_t dx2, dy2, dz2; // Same as direction, only in integer.

      uint8_t LightType;

      uint8_t Filler[3];     // Dummy values = 3 x 0xCD
};
----

`x,y,z` values shouldn't be used by sun type light, but sun seems to have a large `x` value (9 million, give or take), a zero `y` value, and a small `z` value
(4..20) in the original TR5 levels.

`In` and `Out` values aren't used by _sun_ type. For the _spot_ type, these are the _hotspot_ and _falloff angle_ cosines. For the _light_ and _shadow_ types,
these are the TR units for the _hotspot / falloff_ (1024 = 1 sector).

`RadIn`, `RadOut` and `Range` are only used by the _spot_ light type.

`dx`, `dy` and `dz` values are used only by the _sun_ and _spot_ type lights. They describe the directional vector of the light. This can be obtained by:

* if both `x` and `y` latexmath:[$\mathnormal{LightDirectionVectorX} = \cos(X) * \sin(Y)$]
* latexmath:[$\mathnormal{LightDirectionVectorY} = \sin(X)$]
* latexmath:[$\mathnormal{LightDirectionVectorZ} = \cos(X) * \cos(Y)$]

`x2`, `y2`, `z2`, `dx2`, `dy2` and `dz2` values repeat previous corresponding information in long data types instead of floats.

Room Vertex Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This defines the vertices within a room. As mentioned above, room lighting is internal vertex lighting, except for necessarily external sources like flares,
flame emitters and gunflashes. Room ambient lights and point sources are ignored.

As TR3 introduced colored lighting, room vertex structure drastically changed. It changed once again in TR5, when floating-point numbers were introduced. So
we'll define vertex structure for TR1-2, TR3-4 and TR5 independently.

TR1-2 Room Vertex Structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[[tr_room_vertex]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_vertex  // 8 bytes
{
     tr_vertex Vertex;
       int16_t Lighting;
};
----

`Vertex` is the coordinates of the vertex, relative to <<tr_room_info>> `x` and `z` values.

`Lighting` ranges from 0 (bright) to 0x1FFF (dark). This value is ignored by TR2, and `Lighting2` is used instead with the same brightness range.

TR2 uses an extended version of the structure:

[[tr2_room_vertex]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr2_room_vertex  // 12 bytes
{
     tr_vertex Vertex;
       int16_t Lighting;
      uint16_t Attributes; // A set of flags for special rendering effects
       int16_t Lighting2;  // Almost always equal to Lighting1
};
----

`Attributes` field is a _set of flags_, and their meaning is:

* _Bits 0..4_ are only used together in combination with the `LightMode` field of the <<tr_room>> structure. See below.
* _Bit 15:_ When used in room filled with water, don't move the vertices of the room when viewed from above (normally, when viewed from above, the vertices of a
  room filled with water moves to _simulate_ the refraction of lights in water). Note that when viewed from inside the room filled with water, the vertices of the
  other rooms outside still moves.

`Lighting` field is ignored by TR2, and `Lighting2` is used instead with the same brightness range -- from 0 (bright) to 0x1FFF (dark).

TR3-4 Room Vertex Structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[[tr3_room_vertex]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr3_room_vertex  // 12 bytes
{
     tr_vertex Vertex;
       int16_t Lighting;   // Value is ignored!
      uint16_t Attributes; // A set of flags for special rendering effects
      uint16_t Colour;     // 15-bit colour
};
----

`Lighting` value is ignored by the engine, as now each vertex has its own defined 15-bit colour (see below).

`Attributes` bit flags were extended. Here is the list:

* _Bit 13:_ Water / quicksand surface ``wave'' movement. Brightness is also shifting, if this flag is set (but it's not the same type as with _Bit 14_, it's much
  less noticeable).
* _Bit 14:_ Simulates caustics by constantly shifting vertex colour brightness. Used mainly in underwater rooms, but can be used in rooms without water. In TR2,
  there was a similar effect, but it was assigned for all vertices in any water room.
* _Bit 15:_ Same ``wave'' effect as with _Bit 13_, but without light effect (?).

NOTE: The amplitude of the ``wave'' effect depends on `WaterScheme` value specified in room structure.

`Colour` value specifies vertex colour in 15-bit format (each colour occupies 5 bits). Therefore, each colour value's maximum is _31_. You can use this code to
get each colour:

* _Red:_ `((Colour & 0x7C00) >> 10)`
* _Green:_ `((Colour & 0x03E0) >> 5)`
* _Blue:_ `(Colour & 0x001F)`

TR5 Room Vertex Structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In TR5, room vertex structure was almost completely changed. Coordinates were converted to floats, and normal was added:

[[tr5_room_vertex]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr5_room_vertex  // 28 bytes
{
    tr5_vertex Vertex;     // Vertex is now floating-point
    tr5_vertex Normal;
      uint32_t Colour;     // 32-bit colour
};
----

There is no more `Attributes` field in room vertex structure for TR5.


Room Sprite Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[tr_room_sprite]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_sprite  // 4 bytes
{
    int16_t Vertex;       // Offset into vertex list
    int16_t Texture;      // Offset into sprite texture list
};
----

`Vertex` indicates an index into room vertex list (`Room.Vertices[room_sprite.Vertex]`), which acts as a point in space where to display a sprite.

`Texture` is an index into the sprite texture list.


Room Data Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the whole geometry of the ``room,'' including walls, floors, ceilings, and other embedded landscape. It _does not_ include objects that Lara can
interact with (keyholes, moveable blocks, moveable doors, etc.), neither does it include _static meshes_ (mentioned below in the next section).

The surfaces specified here are rendered surfaces.

CAUTION: This is not a ``real'' C/C++ structure, in that the arrays are sized by the `NumXXX` elements that precede them. Also <<tr_room_vertex>> could be
replaced by any other version-specific room vertex type (`tr3_room_vertex`, etc.).

[[tr_room_data]]
[source,cpp]
----
virtual struct tr_room_data    // (variable length)
{
    int16_t NumVertices;                   // Number of vertices in the following list
    tr2_room_vertex Vertices[NumVertices]; // List of vertices (relative coordinates)

Room Static Mesh Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Positions and IDs of static meshes (e.g. skeletons, spiderwebs, furniture, trees). This is comparable to the <<tr2_item>> structure, except that static meshes
have no animations and are confined to a single room.

TR1 Room Static Mesh Structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[[tr_room_staticmesh]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr_room_staticmesh  // 18 bytes
{
    uint32_t x, y, z;    // Absolute position in world coordinates
    uint16_t Rotation;
    uint16_t Intensity1;
    uint16_t MeshID;     // Which StaticMesh item to draw
};
----

`Intensity1` ranges from 0 (bright) to 0x1FFF (dark).

In `Rotation` field, high two bits (`0xC000`) indicate steps of 90 degrees (e.g. (Rotation >> 14) * 90). However, when parsing this value, no extra bitshifting
is needed, as you can simply interpret it using this formula:

[source,cpp]
----
float Real_Rotation = (float)Rotation / 16384.0f * -90;
----

TR2 Room Static Mesh Structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

TR2 again uses an extended version:

[[tr2_room_staticmesh]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr2_room_staticmesh  // 20 bytes
{
    uint32_t x, y, z;    // Absolute position in world coordinates
    uint16_t Rotation;
    uint16_t Intensity1;
    uint16_t Intensity2; // Absent in TR1
    uint16_t MeshID;     // Which StaticMesh item to draw
};
----

`Intensity2` is seemingly not used, as changing this value does nothing.

TR3-5 Room Static Mesh Structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[[tr3_room_staticmesh]]
[source,cpp]
----
virtual struct tr3_room_staticmesh  // 20 bytes
{
    uint32_t x, y, z;    // Absolute position in world coordinates
    uint16_t Rotation;
    uint16_t Colour;     // 15-bit colour
    uint16_t Unused;     // Not used!
    uint16_t MeshID;     // Which StaticMesh item to draw
};
----

`Colour` value specifies vertex colour in 15-bit format (each colour occupies 5 bits): 0x0[red]RRRRR[green]GGGGG[blue]BBBBB. Therefore, each colour value's
maximum is _31_. You can use this code to get each colour:

* _Red:_ `((Colour & 0x7C00) >> 10)`
* _Green:_ `((Colour & 0x03E0) >> 5)`
* _Blue:_ `(Colour & 0x001F)`

TR5 Room Structure Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In TR5 the room format was drastically changed. The room itself is made up of _sections_. These sections encompass a 3x3 sector grid (actually 3069x3069
pixels). Historically, these sections are referred as _layers_, however, more proper name for them is _volumes_. Layers are organized in a quadtree-like
structure, and their purpose was presumably optimizing rendering by some kind of space partitioning and culling invisible volumes.

Another thing to note is that some _rooms_ in TR5 do not actually contain visible mesh data. If concerned, we will refer to these rooms as _null rooms_.

TR5 Room Layer Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[tr5_room_layer]]
[source,cpp]
----
struct tr5_room_layer   // 56 bytes
{
    uint32_t NumLayerVertices;   // Number of vertices in this layer (4 bytes)
    uint16_t UnknownL1;
    uint16_t NumLayerRectangles; // Number of rectangles in this layer (2 bytes)
    uint16_t NumLayerTriangles;  // Number of triangles in this layer (2 bytes)
    uint16_t UnknownL2;

    uint16_t Filler;             // Always 0
    uint16_t Filler2;            // Always 0

    // The following 6 floats define the bounding box for the layer

    float    LayerBoundingBoxX1;
    float    LayerBoundingBoxY1;
    float    LayerBoundingBoxZ1;
    float    LayerBoundingBoxX2;
    float    LayerBoundingBoxY2;
    float    LayerBoundingBoxZ2;

    uint32_t Filler3;     // Always 0 (4 bytes)
    uint32_t UnknownL6;   // Unknown
    uint32_t UnknownL7;   // Unknown
    uint32_t UnknownL8;   // Always the same throughout the level.
}
----

`UnknownL2` appears to be the number of double sided textures in this layer, however is sometimes 1 off (2 bytes).

The Whole Room Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's where all the room data come together.

Room structure differs drastically across different game versions (especially in TR5). For this reason, we will define each version of Room structure
independently, to avoid confusion. Also, version-specific fields will be described in each version's section in a ``backwards-compatible'' manner, while common
fields with version-specific variations, such as `Flags`, will be described afterwards in separate section.

'These are not ``real'' C/C++ structures, in that the arrays are sized by the `NumXXX` elements that precede them.'

TR1 Room Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it's stored in the file, the <<tr_room_info>> structure comes first, followed by a `uint32_t NumDataWords`, which specifies the number of 16-bit words to
follow.  Those data words must be parsed in order to interpret and construct the variable-length arrays of vertices, meshes, doors, and sectors. Such setup is
also applicable to all variations of room structures, _except_ `tr5_room`, which will be described independently.

[[tr_room]]
[source,cpp]
----
virtual struct tr_room  // (variable length)
{
    tr_room_info info;           // Where the room exists, in world coordinates

    uint32_t NumDataWords;       // Number of data words (uint16_t's)
    uint16_t Data[NumDataWords]; // The raw data from which the rest of this is derived

    tr_room_data RoomData;       // The room mesh

    uint16_t NumPortals;                 // Number of visibility portals to other rooms
    tr_room_portal Portals[NumPortals];  // List of visibility portals

    uint16_t NumZsectors;                                  // ``Width'' of sector list
    uint16_t NumXsectors;                                  // ``Height'' of sector list
    tr_room_sector SectorList[NumXsectors * NumZsectors];  // List of sectors in this room

    int16_t AmbientIntensity;

    uint16_t NumLights;                 // Number of lights in this room
    tr_room_light Lights[NumLights];    // List of lights

    uint16_t NumStaticMeshes;                            // Number of static meshes
    tr2_room_staticmesh StaticMeshes[NumStaticMeshes];   // List of static meshes

    int16_t AlternateRoom;
    int16_t Flags;
};
----

`AmbientIntensity` is a brightness value which affects only _externally-lit_ objects. It ranges from 0 (bright) to 0x1FFF (dark).

`AlternateRoom` (or, as it is called in TRLE terms, _flipped room_) is the number of the room that this room can _flip_ with. In the terms of the gameplay,
_flipped_ room is a state change of the same room -- for example, empty or flooded with water, filled with sand or debris. Alternate room usually has the same
boundaries as original room, but altered geometry and/or texturing. Detailed description of _alternate rooms_ will be provided in a separate section.

TR2 Room Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[tr2_room]]
[source,cpp]

virtual struct tr2_room  // (variable length)
{
    tr_room_info info;           // Where the room exists, in world coordinates

    tr_room_sector SectorList[NumXsectors * NumZsectors];  // List of sectors in this room

    int16_t AmbientIntensity;
    int16_t AmbientIntensity2;  // Usually the same as AmbientIntensity
    int16_t LightMode;

    uint16_t NumLights;                 // Number of point lights in this room
    tr_room_light Lights[NumLights];    // List of point lights

    uint16_t NumStaticMeshes;                            // Number of static meshes
    tr_room_staticmesh StaticMeshes[NumStaticMeshes];   // List of static meshes

    int16_t AlternateRoom;
    int16_t Flags;
};
----

`AmbientIntensity2` value is usually equal to `AmbientIntensity` value. Seems it's not used.

`LightMode` specifies lighting mode special effect, which is applied to all room vertices in conjunction with 5 lowest bits of `Attributes` field belonging to
<<tr_room_vertex>> structure. Here we will refer these 5 bits value to as `effect_value`:

* *0* -- Normal lighting mode, no special effects.
* *2* -- If `effect_value` is in 1-15 range, then vertex lighting is cyclically fading to more bright value. The lower the value is, the deeper the fade to full
  vertex lighting is. If `effect_value` is in 17-30 range (_not_ 31!), then vertex lighting is cyclically fading to more dark value. The higher the value is, the
  deeper the fade to black is. If `effect_value` is 16 or 0, no effect is produced. So practically, `effect_value` serves as a multiplier to overall effect
  brightness.
* *1* -- Produces flickering effect, with `effect_value` acting the same way -- as intensity multiplier.

};
----

`RoomColour` replaces `AmbientIntensity` and `AmbientIntensity2` values from `tr2_room` structure. Note it's _not in `tr_colour4` format_, because colour order
is reversed. It should be treated as ARGB, where A is unused.

`AlternateGroup` was introduced in TR4 to solve long-existing engine limitation, which flipped _all alternate rooms at once_ (see _flipmap_ trigger function
description in <<trigger-functions,Trigger Functions>> section). Since TR4, engine only flips rooms which have similar index in room's `AlternateGroup` field
and trigger operand.

TR5 Room Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it was mentioned before, TR5 room structure was almost completely changed, when compared to previous versions. For example, TR5 completely throws out a
concept of `tr_room_data` structure, shuffles numerous values and structures in almost chaotic manner, and introduces a bunch of completely new parameters
(mostly to deal with _layers_). Also, there is vast amount of _fillers_ and _separators_, which contain no specific data.

NOTE: The one possible reason for such ridiculous structure change is an attempt to _crypt file format_, so it won't be accessed by unofficial level editing
tools, which received major development by that time. Another possible reason is whole TR5 development process was rushed, as the team developed _Tomb Raider:
Angel of Darkness_ at the very same time.

`XELA` landmark seemingly serves as a header for room structure. It is clear that _XELA_ is a reversed _ALEX_, which is most likely the name of TR5 programmer,
'Alex Davis'. It probably indicates that Alex Davis is responsible for changes in room structures.

`RoomDataSize` is a handy value determining the size of the following data. You can use this value to quickly _parse thru_ to the next room.

`EndSDOffset`: usually this number `+216` will give you the offset from the start of the room data to the end of the `SectorData` section. However, it is known
that this uint32_t could be equal to `0xFFFFFFFF`, so to calculate the end of `SectorData`, it is better to use the following value `StartSDOffset + 216 +
((NumXSectors * NumZSectors)*8)`, if you need to obtain this information.

`StartSDOffset`: This number `+216` will give you the offset from the start of the room to the start of the `SectorData` section.

`EndPortalOffset`: this number `+216` will give you the offset from the start of the room to the end of the portal data.

`RoomX`, `RoomY` and `RoomZ` values are positions of room in world coordinates. *NOTE:* If room is _null room_, then each of these values will be `0xCDCDCDCD`.

`NumRoomTriangles` and `NumRoomRectangles` are respectively the numbers of triangular and rectangular faces in a given room. *NOTE:* If room is _null room_,
each of these values will be `0xCDCDCDCD`.

`LightDataSize` is the size of the light data in bytes ('not' in `tr5_room_light` units).

`Unknown6` could probably be a copy of `ReverbInfo` (see further), as its value usually ranges from 0 to 3.

`RoomYTop` and `RoomYBottom` are equal to `yTop` and `yBottom` values in <<tr_room_info>> structure. If room is a _null room_, both of these values are
`0xCDCDCDCD`.

`NumLayers` is a number of layers (volumes) in this room.

`LayerOffset`: this number `+216` will give you an offset from the start of the room data to the start of the layer data.

`VerticesOffset`: this number `+216` will give you an offset from the start of the room data to the start of the verex data.

`PolyOffset`: this number `+216` will give you an offset from the start of the room data to the start of the rectangle/triangle data.

`VerticesSize` is the size of vertex data block in bytes. Therefore, it _must_ be a multiple of `tr5_room_vertex` size, else it means the block size is wrong.

`Faces` is a sequential data array for the room polygons (both `tr_face4` and `tr_face3`),

NOTE: `Faces` array is strictly linked with `NumLayers` value. The data is sequentially structured for each layer -- at first it lists first layer's rectangles
then triangles, followed by the second layer's rectangles and triangles, and so on, until all layers are done.

Common Fields of a Room Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Flags` is an array of various flag bits, which meaning is as follows:

* *Bit 0* -- Room is filled with water.
* *Bit 3* -- {TR2}{TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Set if the _skybox_ can be seen from this room. Used to speed things up: if no rendered room has this bit set, then the sky can
  never been seen, so it is not rendered. Else, if at least one visible room has this bit set, then the sky must be drawn because it is (could be) visible.
* *Bit 5* -- {TR2}{TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Lara's ponytail gets blown by the wind. Beginning with TR3, some particle types are also be blown, if they end up in such room
  (particle type is specified by certain particle flag).
* *Bit 6* -- {TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Unknown. A lot of rooms have this bit set but it seems it does nothing...
* *Bit 7* -- {TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Different meaning in TR3 and TR4/5. In TR3, it means that room is filled with quicksand, while in TR4/5 it presumably blocks _global
  lens flare_ from appearing in that room (in TRLE, checkbox which sets this flag is named _NL_).
* *Bit 8* -- {TR3}{TR4}{TR5} Creates _caustics effect_ similar to that used in water rooms. TRLE sets this bit when the M option is used (in the same time, the
  degree of fading intensity typed by the user is put in the `water_scheme` byte).
* *Bit 9* -- {TR3}{TR4}{TR5} The room has some _water reflectivity_. TRLE sets this bit when the R ('reflectivity') option is used (in the same time, the amount
  of reflectivity typed by the user + 5 is put in the `water_scheme` byte). When the flag is set for normal room and there is water room below it, game engine
  creates ``reflection effect'' above the water surface -- effectively it means that all the vertices at the bottom of the room receive caustics effect described
  well above.
* *Bit 11* -- {TR4}{TR5} Not found in any original TR levels, but when the _D_ flag is set in the TRLE, this bit is set. Was re-used in NGLE as a flag specifying
  _Damage room_.
* *Bit 12* -- {TR4}{TR5} Not found in any original TR levels, but when the _P_ flag is set in the TRLE, this bit is set. Was also re-used in NGLE as a flag
  specifying _Poisonous room_.

{TR3}{TR4}{TR5} `WaterScheme` is used for different purposes. If room is a water room, then it specifies underwater caustics patterns. If it is set for normal
room _placed above the water room_, then it controls _wave strength_ effect applied to the faces adjoining water room. Maximum value in both cases is 15.

{TR3}{TR4}{TR5} `ReverbInfo` defines _room reverberation type_. It affects sound postprocessing, if listener position belongs to that room. This feature was
present _only in PlayStation versions_ of the game, but not on PC. Nevertheless, the info is preserved in PC level files. Here are the types of reverberation:

* *0* -- Outside. No (or barely heard) reverberation.
* *1* -- Small room. Little reverberation.
* *2* -- Medium room.
* *3* -- Large room.
* *4* -- Pipe. Highest reverberation level. Almost never used.
