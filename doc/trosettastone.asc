Introduction
------------

Until now the Tomb Raider community, especially programmers and resource hacking enthusiasts, referenced a document called _TRosettaStone_, which hadn't been
updated since 1999, and its revised version (we can call it _TRosettaStone 2_), which was done by E. Popov in 2000 or 2001. Both of these documents served well
for their time, but they were plagued by many errors and inaccuracies.

Many people noted these errors and inaccuracies, but nobody of them revised existing documentation, keeping all their knowledge just in their head. It is widely
known that original document lacks some info here and there, and something is wrongly described -- but it's _not mentioned anywhere_ (except some lost forum
posts). So when a newbie programmer comes to community, he has to come through all the same trials and errors as everyone else once came.

``It shouldn't happen like that.''

The purpose of _TRosettaStone 3_ is to replace original document and serve as the comprehensive source of information for anyone willing to participate in
classic-era Tomb Raider software development. We will use original TRosettaStone as a basis, heavily borrowing from E. Popov revision. Also, this document will
widely borrow information from TREP user's manual, NGLE manual, and a bunch of forum threads and messages concerning internal game engine structures.

However, while original TRosettaStone and update by Popov were aimed primarily at exploring already existing game assets, such as levels, sound files, scripts,
etc., this document is being created by and as a reference for programmers who are creating open-source reimplementations of original game engines. Because of
this, we will sometimes explore not only game file formats, but also internal game logic, procedures and other related aspects. It will be updated synchronously
with development of _OpenTomb_, one of such reimplementation projects, which has received lots of feedback from the community.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This document contains detailed descriptions of the classic-era Tomb Raider data file formats. It is assumed that the reader has knowledge and experience
programming in C or C++ and has at least a passing familiarity with graphics programming. This document is self-contained; all hyperlinks refer only to itself.

All information in this document was derived independently, without the aid or assistance of anyone at Core Design or Eidos. As such, the information in this
document may contain errors or omissions, and many structure and variable names were deduced from the interpretation of the data (and therefore could be
misleading or completely wrong). However, we re-use certain variable and function names from original Tomb Raider debug builds and mappings/symbols from the
leaked Tomb Raider Chronicles PSX SDK.

All the information in this document was tested and is therefore plausible, but could also be a misinterpretation. All information herein is provided as is --
you get what you pay for, and this one’s free. This is a spare-time project that set out to document the Tomb Raider file formats.

Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, game versions are referenced by abbreviations:

* *TR1* refers to Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business
* *TR2* refers to Tomb Raider II and Tomb Raider: The Golden Mask
* *TR3* refers to Tomb Raider III and Tomb Raider: The Lost Artifact
* *TR4* refers to Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation
* *TR5* refers to Tomb Raider: Chronicles

NOTE: As level formats are concerned, *TR4* usually applies not only to original game, but to _custom levels_ built by fans using _Tomb Raider Level Editor_
(`winroomedit.exe`) version `.49`, used to work with TR4-specific level file format. This level editor version is the only one level editor officially released
by Eidos / Core, along with TR5.

When we provide some version-specific info about certain structures or methods, this information will be marked with special bullet images, defining engine
versions for which this info is applicable: {TR1} is for TR1, {TR2} is for TR2, {TR3} is for TR3, {TR4} is for TR4, and {TR5} is for TR5. Version-specific
information will continue up to the next paragraph or list entry, until otherwise noted.


Also, if external programs and utilities are involved, here are abbreviations for them:

* *TRLE* refers to Tomb Raider Level Editor -- an official tool by Core Design used to build levels.
* *NGLE* refers to TRLE version which was unofficially patched and now extensively used by level editing community.
* *Dxtre3d* refers to so-called _unofficial_ level editor developed by Felix aka _Turbo Pascal_.
* *TREP* refers to a binary patcher which is used to patch _TR4 engine_ in its _Level Editor_ version (bundled with TR5) for some advanced features and upgrades
  by level editing community.
* *TRNG* is another patcher with same purpose as TREP, however, incompatible with it. TRNG offers even more advanced features and upgrades to old _TR4 engine_.
* *FLEP* refers to a similar patcher as _TREP_, which is used for same _TR4 engine_, albeit previously modified by _TRNG_.

Current Unknowns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Room light structure from TR4 needs additional description.
. Same for TR5 room light structure.
. Exact description of what is exactly ``room layer'' in TR5.
. Clarify the meaning of _Bit 4_ in <<tr2_room_vertex>> structure.
. Clarify, what's the purpose of `Normal` field in <<tr5_room_vertex>> structure, and if really `Attributes` field was removed.
. Whole `tr5_room` structure needs detailed analysis with all its extra _Unknown_ fields.
. Clarify fog bulb values which affect its radius.
. Solve the purpose of 'flag/zone' field in `tr_camera` structure.
. What's the purpose of bits 0-2 (mapping correction) in 'flags' field in `tr4_object_texture` structure?
. Clarify the box-overlap-zone relation in NPC behaviour section.
