/*!
 * @header bordered_texture_atlas.h
 * @abstract Defines a texture atlas that adds a border around each tile.
 * @discussion To the outside, the bordered texture atlas shows a very similar
 * API as the normal texture atlas (which it will hopefully replace), and it
 * fulfills the same duty: Combine the millions of small Tomb Raider texture
 * pages (four-digit numbers have been observed) into few big pages. To avoid
 * issues with mipmapping and anisotropic filtering, it adds a border (you can
 * choose the width) around each tile, which is just that edge copied.
 *
 * Using it is fairly simple:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create it with @see BorderedTextureAtlas_Create.
 *   <li>Give it references to all original pages with
 *       @see BorderedTextureAtlas_AddPage.
 *   <li>Inform it about all Tomb Raider object textures with
 *       @see BorderedTextureAtlas_AddObjectTexture.
 *   <li>Create the texture data and upload it with
 *       @see BorderedTextureAtlas_CreateTextures
 *   <li>Get the new page and texture coordinates with
 *       @see BorderedTextureAtlas_GetCoordinates
 *   <li>Destroy it with @see BorderedTextureAtlas_Destroy.
 * </ol>
