 * Sets the minimum size of the font buffer that is needed, in bytes, and
 * returns a write-only pointer to the new data.
 *
 * At least the given amount of bytes will be available after. The initial
 * contents will be undefined.
 *
 * If the buffer's internal structures don't exist yet, they are created.
 *
 * Nothing may be read from the pointer, not even data that was previously
 * written! The writes (may, depending on driver) go more ore less
 * directly to the GPU, and the reverse path may not be set up, so reading
 * will result in undefined behavior.

 * Sets the buffer as the current draw buffer. Must not be called between
